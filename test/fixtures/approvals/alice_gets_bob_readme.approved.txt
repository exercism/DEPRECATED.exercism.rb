# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whatever.' if you tell him something.

He answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him (ALL CAPS).

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

Bob, Inspired by the 90s, is bringing back "l33t sP34k", and he'll teach you how to do it. Start any sentence with "Bro, ", and he'll translate the rest of it into l33t sP34k for you.

## Hints

`gets`, _get string_ is the opposite of `puts` _put string_.

Notice that when you type "Something" and then hit enter, you get the string
`"Something\n"`
